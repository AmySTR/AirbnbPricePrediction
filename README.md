# Final Year Project: Airbnb Price Prediction using Machine Learning <br>

1. Project description: <br>
This project uses Bangkok Airbnb data (as of March 2023) to develop Airbnb price prediction model to predict rental prices for Airbnb listings. <br>
Objectives of the project is to identify important features that help property host in improving the listing price.<br>
Dataset is cleaned and pre-processed. Multiple models are then trained and compared the fitness of the model. <br>
Feature selection technique is also implemented to linear regression and neural network model to exclude less significant featues. <br>

Jupyter notebook is used to complete this project. <br>
2. To run the notebook: <br>
- load dataset.<br>
- clean and normalized dataset.<br>
- train the data with <br>
-   5-fold cross validation technique <br>
-   machine learning techniques: linear regression, bagging regression, neural network, gradient boosting, decision tree regressor, random forest regression and XGBoost. <br>
